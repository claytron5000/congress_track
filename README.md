# congress_track
The application is one that helps users keep track of their congressional representatives, how they have voted on what bills. The idea is to have a dashboard that shows your particular Representative, the bills they've recently voted on, and how the voted. An obvious expansion to the app is to show the Senators as well. A more ambitious and probably out of reach of this phase would be to also have your state representatives, and state senators on the dashboard. That last one would be a challenge on many levels, not least of which is that each state has a different form of state government.
